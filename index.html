			<h3>=="Who IS Jack?"==</h3>

			<p>A true jack of all trades, Jack is incredibly smart (see <a href="brainsize.html">brain size</a>). He's a chess playin' businessman who is know for being the best and the brightest at everything.</p>

			<p>Jack is incredibly handsome, bening quoted as "The Face of Beauty". Jack is (allegedly) 6'1, which helps him out tremendously in basketball.</p>

			<p>Jack is cracked at basketball, having (allegedly) 3 NBA offers from The Kings, The Nets, and The Jaguars. He frequently dunks and drains threes because he can. One nearby classmate was even quoted saying jack was "Really good at basketball".</p>

			<p>Jack's long time rival, Ritvik, is incredibly jealous of Jack. Compared to Jack, Ritvik can't touch the Rim, and has only been quoted as being "not bad looking, I guess".</p>

			<p>Both Ritvik and Jack are good friends, unless they are arguing about either basketball or chess, with Jack considering Ritvik to be "Extremely Handsome". Ritvik is rumored to be the only person on earth to be better than Jack at chess.</p>
