			<h1>Jack's Early Life:</h1> <div id="break"><hr></div>
		
			<p>Jack MacMurdo was (allegedly) born in Albuquerque New Mexico, and showed early signs of incredible mental prowess.</p>

			<p>The adults around him quickly realized Jack was special, and Jack even skipped Kindergarten (probably for being too smart). Jack also started playing chess a few years later, redefining the sport through his sheer skill.</p>

			<p>Jack also has a medal from one of those gymnastics buses, so clearly his athletic ability was apparent at an early age.</p>
